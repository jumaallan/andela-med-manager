# Andela Med-Manager [![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/jumaallan/Andela-Med-Manager/tree/master.shield?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/jumaallan/Andela-Med-Manager/tree/master)

Med-Manager is a simple app that helps patients remember to take their medication and provides tracking for the intake of the prescribed medication intake.

The app uses the MVVM Architecture. I have used the following components for development:

* Room - For offline data persistence
* LiveData - Handle data in a lifecycle-aware fashion 
* ViewModel - Manage your UI's data in a lifecycle-aware fashion
